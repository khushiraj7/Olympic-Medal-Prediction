# 🏅 Olympic Medal Prediction

This project is a **basic machine learning model** that predicts how many medals a country can win in the Olympics. It is based on **the number of athletes** participating and **previous medal counts**.

## 📊 Dataset
The model uses:
- Number of **athletes** in a country.
- **Previous medal counts** won by the country.

## 🔍 Model & Approach
- Uses **Linear Regression** from `scikit-learn` to predict medal counts.
- Trained using **past Olympic data**.
- Evaluated using **mean squared error (MSE)**.
